Honey Coupon Code Clipper Clone

The idea here was to merge promotional coupon codes from social media (product influencers) and apply them to any checkout page.

# Project Structure

3 Main folders here:

Backend - contains API to access product information, coupon codes.
Chrome extension - Displays price changes, product videos as you browse, and applies coupons automatically.
Scraper - Scraped amazon products and tik tok videos.

## Tech stack: 

Backend: Python Django
Db: Mongodb
